# Saving

### Multiple Games in the same domain.

You may have multiple games in the same domain, if you keep the default save name in all of them, you'll notice they'll share the save and load slots. Thats why, you can change the name prefix of the save slots in the options.js file, just change the value of the `engine["slots"]` variable.

### Change Number of Save Slots

You can easily increase or decrease the number of save slots available for your game. Simply go to the options.js file and change the `engine["Slots"]` value to any number you want.
