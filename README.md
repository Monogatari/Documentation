# Welcome

## Overview

While this documentation covers many parts of Monogatari's functioning, it does not cover everything you could actually do with it. Remember, your VN is a website now and that means the possibilities are endless. Everything you've seen on a website before can be done in your game.

But how to look out for help on doing this things? Well, another benefit of your game being a website is: There is lots and lots of tutorials and documentation out there!

If you google something, for example if you want something to happen when someone clicks an image, you can google it as "JavaScript click image", there's no need to look for a Monogatari-specific answer. Everything that applies to a website also applies for Monogatari, even the step-by-step tutorials on web development are useful to get you started.

Of course, you are not alone! If you have any doubt, problem or just want some help please reach out!
