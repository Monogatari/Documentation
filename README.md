# Getting Started

**This documentation is still under revision.**

Any text editor should work for creating your game with Monogatari, even Windows NotePad, I recomend you to use [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).

If you have any doubt, problem or just want some help please contact me, I'll be glad to help. You can contact me by  [Mail](hyuchia%28at%29gmail%28dot%29com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HyuchiaDiego) or [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+HyuchiaDiego/)
