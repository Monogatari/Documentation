# Step 3: Get Familiarized

Once you've [downloaded the latest Monogatari release](getting-monogatari.md), take some time to get familiar with the files and directories inside it.

You can take a look at a more visual representation of the Monogatari project structure [in this simple mind map](https://www.mindmeister.com/1136161346/monogatari-project-structure).

### Directories

You'll find some directories, here is what you should use them for.

| Directory | Contains |
| :--- | :--- |
| `assets` | This is where all your assets such as images, audio files, font files etc. should go |
| `engine` | The core engine files that make everything work. Updating Monogatari is as simple as replacing this directory. |
| `js` | This is where you'll set your game configuration and create your game script. |
| `style` | CSS files for your project \(CSS defines the look and style of your game\). |

## **Root Directory**

Inside the main directory you'll find some pretty useful files.

| File | Contains |
| :--- | :--- |
| `index.html` | This is your main file, open this file in a browser and there's your game! |
| `manifest.json` |  |
| `robots.txt` | This file asks crawlers and other bots to keep your assets directory unindexed from web searches. |
| `service-worker.js` | This file defines your service worker, used for asset preloading and caching |
| `.htaccess` | This file provides a basic Apache configuration in case you are using that web server. |

More about what to do and how to use these specific files will come later as you read the documentation.

**JS Directory**

JavaScript is the programming language you'll be using in Monogatari, it is what makes all your game work.

| File | Contains |
| :--- | :--- |
| `main.js` | If you want to add more javascript, this is the file to do it! |
| `options.js` | Initial settings of your game and engine settings. |
| `script.js` | The main script of your game. \(Here's where your story, characters, images etc are declared\) |
| `storage.js` | This is where you'll declare your custom variables that you want to save in your games. |

**Style Directory**

CSS is the markup language used to style your game, from setting colors to improving the appearance, CSS is what will allow you do them all.

| File | Contains |
| :--- | :--- |
| `main.css` | Add your styling in this file. |
