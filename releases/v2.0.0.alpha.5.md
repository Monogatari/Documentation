## Change Log

### New Features

* Belarusian and Korean languages have been added

### Bug Fixes

* `ForceAspectRatio` flag would not resize the game and its elements correctly
* Characters keeping the classes between show statements caused some unexpected behaviors
* Dialog log placeholder would not be removed after logging the first dialog on it
* Global audio stop statement was not working correctly and it wouldn't stop the media
* Main menu music would not be played
* Text speed setting was not working and speed remained the same if changed
* Removing a listener would not remove the keyboard shortcut

### Other Changes

* Action ids are now case insensitive
* Monogatari now holds a global configuration and components should use that instead of keeping one internally
* Main and Quick menus now use the `render` function as all the other components to create and show their buttons
* The `main.js` file now includes a few words on where code should be placed
* New errors have been added to provide more feedback to developers on common mistakes
* The `quick-menu` element is now being hidden on the splash screen by placing a `splash-screen` class on it
* String interpolation has been optimized so it is done only once while trying to find a matching action for the statement
