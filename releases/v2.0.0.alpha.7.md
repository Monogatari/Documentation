### Rename your Assets Directories and declarations

The following three assets directories have been renamed to a pluralized version to be consistent with the others so you'll have to rename them as well.

| Asset | Old Directory | New Directory |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Voice | `assets/voice/` | `assets/voices/` |
| Sounds | `assets/sound/` | `assets/sounds/` |
| Video | `assets/video/` | `assets/videos/` |

Now, go to the `options.js` file and find your assets directories declarations, they should look something like this:

{% code title="options.js" %}
```javascript
'AssetsPath': {
    'root': 'assets',
    'characters': 'characters',
    'icons': 'icons',
    'images': 'images',
    'music': 'music',
    'scenes': 'scenes',
    'sound': 'sound',
    'ui': 'ui',
    'video': 'video',
    'voice': 'voice',
    'gallery': 'gallery'
},
```
{% endcode %}

You'll have to apply the same naming changes as before, the resulting object would then be:

```javascript
'AssetsPath': {
    'root': 'assets',
    'characters': 'characters',
    'icons': 'icons',
    'images': 'images',
    'music': 'music',
    'scenes': 'scenes',
    'sounds': 'sounds',
    'ui': 'ui',
    'videos': 'videos',
    'voices': 'voices',
    'gallery': 'gallery'
},
```

Notice how `videos`, `voices` and `sounds` are now pluralized. 

Finally, the assets declaration for those three asset types also need to be changed:

**Before:**

```javascript
// Define the voice files used in the game.
monogatari.assets ('voice', {

});

// Define the sounds used in the game.
monogatari.assets ('sound', {

});

// Define the videos used in the game.
monogatari.assets ('video', {

});
```

**After:**

```javascript
// Define the voice files used in the game.
monogatari.assets ('voices', {

});

// Define the sounds used in the game.
monogatari.assets ('sounds', {

});

// Define the videos used in the game.
monogatari.assets ('videos', {

});
```
