# Stop Voice

## Description

```javascript
'stop voice [voice_id] [with fade <time>]'
```

The stop voice action will let you stop either all voices currently playing or only one in specific. To learn more about voices, read the [Play Voice documentation](play-voice.md).

**Note**: Voice audio is automatically stopped when the player advances to the next statement. This action is useful when you want to stop a voice before the player proceeds, or when you have looping voice audio.

**Action ID**: `Stop`

**Reversible**: Yes (restores the previously playing voices from history)

**Requires User Interaction**: No

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| voice\_id | `string` | Optional. The name of the specific voice you want to stop. If omitted, all voices will be stopped. |
| fade | `number` | Optional. Fade out time in seconds. |
